I attract only the bad
Who needs me with such an appearance
Don't trust anyone, you will definitely be deceived
If you dare to stick out, it will not end well
I told you, don't trust anyone
Everything new and unknown is dangerous
Whatever I do, I'm not going to be lucky anyway.
I can't do anything about it
No matter how hard I try, you can't escape fate
I was unlucky to be born into a poor family, so I will die a beggar
I will definitely not succeed, never
I always confuse everything, that's why I'm so stupid
I can't win anyway, you don't even have to try
Who needs me so scary
I'm always unlucky
Nobody loves me
I have a bad memory
I'm a loser
Should I speak publicly? What are you?! It's definitely not mine! 
I have such bad karma
Whatever I do, there is no success in anything
My age does not allow me to do this. 
I will never get behind the wheel, it's deadly dangerous! 
I don't trust anyone, it's dangerous. Just hope, they will immediately let you down
These life obstacles can never be overcome, it's better not to start.
I'll never get well
No medicine will help me
I brought this sore on myself
Excess weight will never go away, it's not even worth trying
What's the use of these meditations, just wasted time
With age, the sores only get worse and increase
Just get to the doctors, they will immediately find a bunch of diseases
No doctor can cure my illness
No one has ever gotten rid of chronic diseases yet – this is a sentence for life
Internal energy will not be returned by anything
I am loved only when I am sick
My kids only call when I'm not feeling well.
Only when I'm sick can I afford to eat fruit
Healthy food is very expensive for me
Drinking a lot of water is harmful, they showed it on TV yesterday.
All men cheat sooner or later
A husband should keep his wife strict
All the guys only need one thing, and the sooner the better
There are no decent girls left now, all available – just whistle, they jump into bed like that
Love happens only in movies and in books, but in life it is more and more pragmatic
One has only to get married, quarrels and resentments immediately begin
I grew up without a father and grandfather, and I will raise a child without a man
I will never be the first to approach, not a man's act, let her crawl on her knees
If a woman in a marriage takes care of herself, then there is someone
All women are bitches
Women are only served: money and shopping
Blondes are all empty-headed
Men are all insensitive
I will never be loved
You can't break through the career ladder, they only move their own
At least a hundred spans in the forehead, the boss will never praise you
At work, initiative is punishable, it's better not to take on too much, do not let your colleagues down
You can't be the smartest in the team, no one likes that
Work is not a wolf, it will not run away into the forest, so do everything at the last moment
There are no good bosses
Never admit your mistakes, otherwise they will punish you
Sit and keep quiet until you are personally, by name and directly asked
Never help anyone, it will not lead to good, anyway, you will be guilty
Any word you say will turn against you
No one needs my experience
There are a lot of younger and more successful people around
Not to work in this profession with such an appearance
You can't get a good job at that age
At least 3 kopecks" but their own, and twice a month
They make a lot of money only by stealing
Honest money is not big
If there is a lot of money, it means that it was obtained fraudulently
To earn your paycheck, you have to sweat
What is received quickly, instantly and is lost
No wonder they say that free cheese is in a mousetrap
Only thieves have mansions and helicopters
You have to pay for help in coin
Unselfishly, no one does anything to anyone
Charity is only for the rich, they have no money, let them help
Why is he so smart and so poor? As soon as money appears, you start to squander it
Wealth is evil, and poverty is not a vice
The more money, the more envy. The more envy, the more diseases
Wealth will not lead to good
Big money is not honest
A lot of money spoils a person
Someone who has a lot of money has a callous soul
In order to earn a million – life is not enough
You have to pay for everything good
